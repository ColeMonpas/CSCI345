The design of our board allows for extensions in many different areas. 
For example:
1. If we wanted to account for a limited supply of money in the bank having a separate class for the bank allows for an economic collapse.

2. We also allow modularity for additional roles on a sceneCard such as tech or makeup that have different payouts, ranks and names.

3. By having the casting office as a separate class it allows for changes to the pricing on different ranks and the number of ranks.

4. As suggested by example 3 a higher ranking system past 6 is easily achievable through the roles, player, casting office and dice. All of these implementations allow for easy changes to be made. 

5. New scenes are also easily changeable by having scenes as its own class, it  allows us to modify the amount of scenes, and even the budgets, and shot counters of the scenes. 

6. Because of our usage of a 2d matrix for the layout, new boards with more zones than just casting offices, scenes, and trailers can easily be added and the board size can be changed as well.

7. Another thing we could easily implement is adding more days to the game entirely, as newDay doesn't rely on anything else.
